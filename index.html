      <img src="Images/Sheet%201.png" alt="Chart 1">
      <p class="caption">Bytedance tops the chart with a remarkable valuation of $180 billion, far surpassing its peers. Trailing behind, SpaceX and SHEIN share the second spot at $100 billion each, followed closely by Stripe at $95 billion. Klarna completes the top five with a $46 billion valuation.

      <h3>2. Number of Unicorns per Continent</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%202.png" alt="Chart 2">
      <p class="caption">North America stands out with a commanding lead of 589 unicorns, while Asia follows with 310 and Europe with 143, collectively dominating the global unicorn scene. In comparison, South America hosts just 21, Oceania 8, and Africa only 3 unicorns‚Äîrevealing a stark disparity in startup activity and investment across regions. This emphasizes the uneven distribution of startup ecosystems and funding opportunities worldwide.

      <h3>3. Companies Founded Before 2000 That Became Unicorns After 2015</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%203.png" alt="Chart 3">
      <p class="caption">These companies exemplify long-term growth, having taken over 15 years to achieve unicorn status. Standout cases like Otto Bock HealthCare, founded in 1919, and Promasidor Holdings, established in 1979, illustrate how legacy businesses can adapt, innovate, and eventually scale to billion-dollar valuations. Their journeys highlight the value of sustained innovation, resilience, and strategic evolution‚Äîchallenging the common perception that unicorn success is exclusive to rapid-growth tech startups.

    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>4. Average Valuation of Companies by Industry</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%204.png" alt="Chart 4">
      <p class="caption">The chart ranks industries based on their average company valuations, revealing where investor confidence is strongest. Leading the pack is Artificial Intelligence, averaging over $4.4 billion‚Äîunderscoring its pivotal role in innovation and automation. Following closely are the "Other" category and Consumer & Retail, both with averages above $4.2 billion, signaling strong activity in diverse and customer-focused sectors. Fintech and E-commerce also rank high, reflecting continued enthusiasm for digital finance and online shopping. While sectors like Health, Cybersecurity, and Telecommunications show comparatively lower average valuations, they still hold significant value‚Äîsuggesting their importance, though possibly limited by regulation or market maturity. This breakdown serves as a key guide for targeting high-potential industries in investment and strategic planning.

      <h3>5. Companies with the Most Selective Investors</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%205.png" alt="Chart 5">
      <p class="caption">Companies backed by a select group of prominent investors are often perceived as more stable, well-connected, and strategically supported. This insight is especially useful for venture capitalists, analysts, and founders seeking to evaluate credibility, investor dynamics, and funding patterns. The graph above showcases the top 15 unicorns with the highest number of selective investors, most of which have 3 to 4 major backers. Leading names like Bytedance, Niantic, Skydio, and Yixia each have 4 key investors, reflecting strong market appeal and trust. Although the number of investors per company is relatively modest, it points to a focused investment strategy‚Äîwhere a few carefully chosen stakeholders participate, often due to strategic fit or exclusive funding opportunities.

      <h3>6. Top 10 Companies With The Highest Funding-to-Valuation Ratio</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%206.png" alt="Chart 6">
      <p class="caption">Snapdeal, REEF Technology, Hello TransTech, and Fair each exhibit a funding-to-valuation ratio of 200%, indicating they've raised double their current market valuation‚Äîpotentially pointing to overfunding or high cash burn. Magic Leap follows closely with a ratio of 150%. Meanwhile, companies like Momenta, OVH, and SaltPay show a balanced 1:1 ratio (100%), where their raised capital matches their valuation. These figures can reveal possible inefficiencies in capital deployment or signal aggressive, high-risk growth strategies.

      <h3>7. Most Common Industry by Continent</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%207.png" alt="Chart 7">
      <p class="caption">This chart highlights key industry trends across continents, offering valuable insight for strategic business planning. In North America, the prevalence of Internet Software & Services and Fintech reflects its leadership in digital innovation and financial technology. Asia‚Äôs strength in E-commerce underscores its booming consumer markets, while Europe‚Äôs strong Fintech presence likely stems from its mature banking infrastructure and supportive regulations. Although Africa and South America have fewer unicorns overall, their growing emphasis on Fintech points to efforts in enhancing financial inclusion. These patterns help investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers identify where innovation is thriving and which regions present sector-specific growth opportunities.

      <img src="Images/Sheet%208.png" alt="Chart 8">
      <p class="caption">JUUL Labs tops the Consumer & Retail sector with an impressive $14 billion valuation, significantly outpacing the industry average. In the Artificial Intelligence space, companies like Bytedance and Argo AI also draw attention, each securing multi-billion-dollar funding‚Äîhighlighting strong investor confidence in emerging technologies.

Meanwhile, the repeated presence of companies in Auto & Transportation, E-commerce & Direct-to-Consumer, and Supply Chain & Logistics‚Äîsuch as Swiggy and J&T Express‚Äîshows these sectors benefit from substantial investment due to their scalability and consumer demand. Altogether, the chart offers a strategic snapshot of where investors see the most promise, helping guide decisions in business development and capital allocation.

      <h3>9. Shortest Time from Founding to Unicorn Status</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%209a.png" alt="Chart 9">
      <p class="caption">Identifying the fastest-growing unicorns‚Äîthose that reached billion-dollar valuations in record time‚Äîis crucial for strategic investment and market analysis. Many of these startups attained unicorn status within just a year of their founding, with standout cases like Ola Electric Mobility (182 days) and Playco (264 days) achieving it in under six months. Such rapid growth indicates highly scalable models, aggressive expansion tactics, and substantial investor support. Interestingly, Yidian Zixun shows a negative timeline, suggesting a potential data issue where its unicorn status predates its founding‚Äîa discrepancy worth verifying for accuracy.

    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>10. Companies Founded the Longest Ago but Still Unicorns</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%2010.png" alt="Chart 10">
      <p class="caption">The chart above showcases the ten oldest companies that eventually reached unicorn status, with founding years spanning from 1919 to 1995. These organizations illustrate that while their billion-dollar valuations came much later, long-term growth and resilience can still lead to substantial success. Epic Games, founded in 1991, is a standout example with a remarkable valuation of $32 billion, highlighting the powerful impact of its business strategy and market presence. Overall, the data underscores that achieving unicorn status isn‚Äôt always rapid‚Äîenduring companies can also rise to prominence over time.

      <h3>11. Average Time (in Years) from Founding to Unicorn Status by Continent</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%2011.png" alt="Chart 11">
      <p class="caption">Asian startups top the list for speed, attaining unicorn status in just 6.61 years on average, with North American companies close behind at 6.88 years. Startups in South America, Africa, and Oceania generally take a bit longer, while Europe trails with the slowest average timeline of around 8.25 years. This pattern suggests that startup ecosystems in Asia and North America tend to support faster business scaling, whereas European ventures may experience more extended growth paths before reaching billion-dollar valuations.

      <h3>12. Most Common Founding Years Among Unicorns</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%2012.png" alt="Chart 12">
      <p class="caption">The chart shows that 2015 was the most common founding year for unicorn companies, with 155 startups established that year. This is followed by 2016 (110 companies) and 2014 (109 companies), indicating a surge in entrepreneurial activity and successful scaling during the mid-2010s. The trend suggests that many of today‚Äôs unicorns were founded in the early to mid-2010s, aligning with the global tech boom, increased VC funding, and the rise of digital platforms during that period.
