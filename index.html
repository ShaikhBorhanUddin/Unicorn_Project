    <p>This report features 17 carefully crafted SQL queries designed to extract key insights from the unicorn startup landscape. Each query addresses a strategic business question, turning raw data into meaningful intelligence that supports data-driven decision-making.

From identifying the Top 5 Most Valuable Companies to uncovering the Countries with the Most Unicorns Founded After 2022, this analysis spans valuation trends, regional performance, investor patterns, and sector-specific insights. You'll explore how unicorns are distributed across continents, which industries attract the highest average valuations, and which companies are scaling fastest or operating with exceptional funding efficiency.

By examining metrics such as average time to unicorn status, most common founding years, and selective investor presence, the report highlights both long-term success stories and emerging disruptors.

      <h3>1. Top 5 Most Valuable Companies</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%201.png" alt="Chart 1">
      <p class="caption">Bytedance tops the chart with a remarkable valuation of $180 billion, far surpassing its peers. Trailing behind, SpaceX and SHEIN share the second spot at $100 billion each, followed closely by Stripe at $95 billion. Klarna completes the top five with a $46 billion valuation. These numbers underscore the strong presence of companies rooted in technology and innovation-driven industries.

      <h3>2. Number of Unicorns per Continent</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%202.png" alt="Chart 2">
      <p class="caption">North America stands out with a commanding lead of 589 unicorns, while Asia follows with 310 and Europe with 143, collectively dominating the global unicorn scene. In comparison, South America hosts just 21, Oceania 8, and Africa only 3 unicorns‚Äîrevealing a stark disparity in startup activity and investment across regions. This emphasizes the uneven distribution of startup ecosystems and funding opportunities worldwide.

    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>3. Companies Founded Before 2000 That Became Unicorns After 2015</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%203.png" alt="Chart 3">
      <p class="caption">These companies exemplify long-term growth, having taken over 15 years to achieve unicorn status. Standout cases like Otto Bock HealthCare, founded in 1919, and Promasidor Holdings, established in 1979, illustrate how legacy businesses can adapt, innovate, and eventually scale to billion-dollar valuations. Their journeys highlight the value of sustained innovation, resilience, and strategic evolution‚Äîchallenging the common perception that unicorn success is exclusive to rapid-growth tech startups.

</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>4. Average Valuation of Companies by Industry</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%204.png" alt="Chart 4">
      <p class="caption">The chart ranks industries based on their average company valuations, revealing where investor confidence is strongest. Leading the pack is Artificial Intelligence, averaging over $4.4 billion‚Äîunderscoring its pivotal role in innovation and automation. Following closely are the "Other" category and Consumer & Retail, both with averages above $4.2 billion, signaling strong activity in diverse and customer-focused sectors. Fintech and E-commerce also rank high, reflecting continued enthusiasm for digital finance and online shopping. While sectors like Health, Cybersecurity, and Telecommunications show comparatively lower average valuations, they still hold significant value‚Äîsuggesting their importance, though possibly limited by regulation or market maturity. This breakdown serves as a key guide for targeting high-potential industries in investment and strategic planning.

    <div>
      <h3>5. Companies with the Most Selective Investors</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%205.png" alt="Chart 5">
      <p class="caption">Companies backed by a select group of prominent investors are often perceived as more stable, well-connected, and strategically supported. This insight is especially useful for venture capitalists, analysts, and founders seeking to evaluate credibility, investor dynamics, and funding patterns. The graph above showcases the top 15 unicorns with the highest number of selective investors, most of which have 3 to 4 major backers. Leading names like Bytedance, Niantic, Skydio, and Yixia each have 4 key investors, reflecting strong market appeal and trust. Although the number of investors per company is relatively modest, it points to a focused investment strategy‚Äîwhere a few carefully chosen stakeholders participate, often due to strategic fit or exclusive funding opportunities.

      <h3>6. Top 10 Companies With The Highest Funding-to-Valuation Ratio</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%206.png" alt="Chart 6">
      <p class="caption">Snapdeal, REEF Technology, Hello TransTech, and Fair each exhibit a funding-to-valuation ratio of 200%, indicating they've raised double their current market valuation‚Äîpotentially pointing to overfunding or high cash burn. Magic Leap follows closely with a ratio of 150%. Meanwhile, companies like Momenta, OVH, and SaltPay show a balanced 1:1 ratio (100%), where their raised capital matches their valuation. These figures can reveal possible inefficiencies in capital deployment or signal aggressive, high-risk growth strategies.

      <h3>7. Most Common Industry by Continent</h3>
      <img src="Images/Sheet%207.png" alt="Chart 7">
      <p class="caption">This chart highlights key industry trends across continents, offering valuable insight for strategic business planning. In North America, the prevalence of Internet Software & Services and Fintech reflects its leadership in digital innovation and financial technology. Asia‚Äôs strength in E-commerce underscores its booming consumer markets, while Europe‚Äôs strong Fintech presence likely stems from its mature banking infrastructure and supportive regulations. Although Africa and South America have fewer unicorns overall, their growing emphasis on Fintech points to efforts in enhancing financial inclusion. These patterns help investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers identify where innovation is thriving and which regions present sector-specific growth opportunities.
